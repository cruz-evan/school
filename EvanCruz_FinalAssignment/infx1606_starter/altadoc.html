						<h3>Layout/Usability</h3>
							<h5>Color</h5>
							<p>
								Color is one way that this site has been made to be more useable. The table that has been included in the site contains color which is consistent as to which
								competitive groups have class. Since only Dave's group trains at different times the color is geared more to inform Dave's group when they have class. However
								it can be used for other groups as well. Green is no class, blue is other groups + Dave's group, red is not Dave's group, and purple is just Dave's group. Color
								is used not just to inform the user but to enhance it. By having these colors present it makes it easier to assume when classes are. Text is also added on top of
								this to make sure fully accurate data is portrayed.
							</p>
							<h5>Consistency</h5>
							<p>
								The site is highly consistent throughout it. The same menu system is used on every page to ensure that the user knows where the menu is on every page. The same
								site header is used on every page to portray that the user has not left the site. The same size of secondary header is also used on each page that also re-enforces the user has not left.
								Also the same background image is used on all pages to re-enforce that the user has not left. Further, a consistent width for the content is used on each page. 
								The same footer is also used on the same page so that important information and links are always available to the user. By having all of these things consistent,
								the users can determine where they are and where the important data is with ease.
							</p>
							<h5>Predictability</h5>
							<p>
								The site contains some expected elements that are present in most sites. As for many sites the menu is utilized through the hamburger icon. By clicking on it the menu
								slides in from the right and the user has access to all of the menu items. If the user clicks back on the hamburger icon the menu returns to it's hidden state. By having
								a hamburger icon, the user can easily detect where the menu is and access it from all pages. A logo for Alta Gymnastics is also used to return home. This is also very common
								in websites, this allows the users to easily find the home button and access it throughout the site.Also like most sites, links are underlined. By having links underlined, 
								they are easy for the user to detect and differentiate from regular text. 
							</p>
							<h5>C.R.A.P</h5>
							<p>
								This site abides by the CRAP principals. It has contrast which allows the users to easily determine what is the main header, sub-header, and sub content. Each of the content
								areas has differently sized headers and paragraphs which allows the user to see the groupings of information and therefore organizes it. There is also white space separating
								different groups of information which also helps the user determine the grouping of information. As discussed in consistency, the website is repetitive which allows for users
								to easily navigate the site. The page is also well aligned. All of the content is held within the #SmallContentHold and all of the content is aligned to the left of the page
								which gives the user a sense of containment. Also the two clickable links on the title bar are also aligned such that the underline is beneath the links and header and are aligned by the top with each other.
							    Finally proximity is also present in the page. As discussed before the elements of the page are not placed arbitrarily, and most paragraphs are close to their respective headers.
							</p>
							<h5>Readability</h5>
							<p>
								The site is also easily readable. By having the text sizes larger than the default sizes, it allows users to easily read what is written on the screen. Also by having text 
								written on white backgrounds the text creates contrast and makes the text easily readable. The menu also looks different from the regular text as it is on a grey background
								with white text. The menu also creates contrast and enhances readability. Also by having media queries present, it ensures that the site is readable with all
								resolutions of screens.

						<h3>JavaScript</h3>
							<h5>Adipoli</h5>
							<p>
								Adipoli is a jQuery plugin that just adds a simple effect to a picture. In this website specifically, the images simply pop-out at the user which gives the 
								images a little bit of added flare and zoom. This functionality is only used on the Picture page
							</p>
							<h5>jBox</h5>
							<p>
								jBox is a jQuery plugin which adds tooltip boxes to an item. In this website the tooltips are placed to the right of the photos on the picture page. The
								tooltip is then used to give further information on the hovered photo. 
							</p>
							<h5>Sidr</h5>
							<p>
								Sidr creates a menu that slides in from a given direction. In this website the menu is accessed from the hamburger icon on the top of each page next to the
								header. The menu then slides out from the left giving access to the links to the other pages.
							</p>

						<h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>
							<h5>Keyword Focus</h5>
							<p>
								To SEO this site, the focused keywords are repeated multiple times near the top of the index page. The words "Halifax" "Alta" and "Gymnastics" are used
								multiple times to try and boost the chances that when any of those words are searched, the site is found. "Alta" is also used in the alt tags of photos 
								to further the fact that "Alta" is a keyword. Web crawler will see that these words are used multiple times and hopefully classify them as keywords.
							</p>
							<h5>Title and Meta Usage</h5>
							<p>
								The site uses proper meta tags with information pertaining to the given page. Each page of the site has a title that is relevant to the content on the 
								given pages. Each "description" meta tag also contains information that relates to the information on the given page. Since this information is fairly
								high up in the document, web crawlers can find it and parse it quickly.
							</p>
							<h5>Clean, Validating Code</h5>
							<p>
								All of the code in each of the pages on the site clears the W3C validators for both CSS and HTML. By having good, validating code the website is more
								likely to have a higher chance of being found by a search engine then one that is poorly coded. It also allows for easier webcrawler access and accuracy.
							</p>
							<h5>Alt tag usage</h5>
							<p>
								As discussed in the keyword section, the images all use an alt tag. Since webcrawlers only parse text, having an alt tag gives a description of what
								the image is. The alt text is essentially what will be indexed by the webcrawlers. 
							</p>
							<h5>Linking</h5>
							<p>
								The site has a few external links to other sites which should improve the sites ranking. At the bottom of each page there is a footer portion that links
								to external sites. External links have more weight towards ranking to it than internal links. Having other sites link to this one would also improve it's
								rank, however this is a new site and it is not online so there are no other sites linking to it.
							</p>
							<h5>URL</h5>
							<p>
								Because this site is not actually on-line it does not have a URL associated with it. By having an easy to read url with clear keywords, the site will recieve
								a higher score. A URL that would be good for this site would be something like halifaxalta.ca or halifaxaltagymnastics.ca.

						<h3>Accessibility</h3>
							<h5>Large Text</h5>
							<p>
								The site contains a lot of large text. By having large text it makes it easier for people with poorer vision to read the site and interpret what 
								information is trying to be conveyed.
							</p>
							<h5>Pop-out images with tooltips</h5>
							<p>
								The images on the pictures page pop-out at the user which creates a slight zoom effect. By having them pop-out it makes the image easier to see and
								interpret. By having tooltips attached to the images it enhances its use by giving a description of what the photo is trying to depict. All of the 
								images also contain alt text in case the images do not work.
							</p>
							<h5>No audio</h5>
							<p>
								The site contains no audio elements so there is no audio played throughout the site. This can save a users ears by not playing loud sounds when they
								are not prepared for it.
							</p>
							<h5>2 Ways to Return Home</h5>
							<p>
								The site has a 2 ways to return home. The user can either click the hamburger and then click home or they can click the home option, or they can click
								the Halifax Alta icon to return to home. By having two ways to return home it makes sure that users can easily find their way to the homepage. 
							</p>
							<h5>Color</h5>
							<p>
								The table in the site is used in such a way that enhances it use with color. The color shows which groups have class at given times. By having color it
								makes it easier to see the important, relevent information with ease. If a person is color-blind text is also added to ensure that all readers can
								determine the relevent information.
							</p>
							<h5>Less than 3 flashes</h5>
							<p>
								The site has no animated objects and therefore does not have any seizure inducing flashes present in the site.
							</p>
							<h5>Contact information</h5>
							<p>
								The site also has two ways that convey contact information with Halifax Alta. The basic contact information is included in the footer and more detailed
								information is given on the actual Contact Us page. This allows for users to easily find contact info at the bottom which is usually expected and find more
								detailed information on the Contact Us page if needed.
							</p>
							<h5>Titled pages</h5>
							<p>
								The titles of the pages are at the top of each tab and also present on the page. This allows the users to easily locate where they are
							</p>
							<h5>Media Query</h5>
							<p>
								A media query is used so that people with smaller screens do not experience the website breaking. The footer places all of the content vertically instead of
								horizontally. Also at 800px or less the content holders are changed to 100% so that the text doesn't get too cramped at very small screen resolutions.
